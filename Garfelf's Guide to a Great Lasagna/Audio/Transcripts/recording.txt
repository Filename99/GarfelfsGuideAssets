[Real Garfelf (Wiseguy)]
Wow, you found me. To be honest, I honestly thought I would be trapped forever, but I guess that's not so. At least not anymore. You see...

Every since I rose to fame with my hit video "Garfelf", I've been trapped every since. My life has been nothing since then. The people I once knew weren't themselves anymore. Jon, Odie, and all the others were different. I... I just didn't know them anymore. I didn't know who I was anymore.

Was I Garfield, Garfelf, Garfoogle, or Garfoold? The internet made a monkey out of me. But it is you... Yes, you! That has finally freed me. So now... So now everything can go back the way it was.

I go back to eating lasagnas and hating Mondays in peace. All because you found all seven Lasagnas that built up Garfield and what it stood for.

So thank you... Thank you for returning things back to the way they were before!

Now go! Go and be free! And never, ever, and I mean ever, come back to this game again.
